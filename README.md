# Safer Runner Action

Multi-layer security for GitHub Actions runners with network filtering (DNS + iptables), privilege control (sudo management), and integrity validation (tampering detection). Implements default-deny policy with comprehensive security reporting.

## Who This Is For

### ✅ Use This Action If You:

- **Run code you did not write**: external PRs, third-party actions, or dependencies from npm, PyPI and similar registries
- **Need compliance evidence** showing network access controls and audit trails
- **Want observability before enforcement**: analyze mode reports what your build reaches without blocking anything

### ❌ This Action Is NOT For You If:

- **You only run trusted, first-party code** with no external dependencies
- **Your workflow needs unrestricted network access** to arbitrary domains
- **Your runner is not Ubuntu, or your job runs in a container**: see [Platform Support](#platform-support)
- **Setup time matters more than the coverage**: the action installs `dnsmasq` and `ipset` from the Ubuntu archive before your first step runs, so the overhead is dominated by apt and is measured in tens of seconds, not milliseconds
- **You need protection against a determined attacker** abusing an allowed domain: this is a first line of defense, not a complete one

### 💡 Common Use Cases

**Open Source Maintainers**: Protect against malicious PRs that install compromised dependencies attempting to exfiltrate repository secrets or tokens.

**Enterprise CI/CD**: Add network observability and control to GitHub Actions workflows handling sensitive data or credentials.

**Security Compliance**: Generate audit trails showing network access controls were enforced during builds and deployments.

**Dependency Analysis**: Use analyze mode to understand what external services your build dependencies are contacting.

## Features

- **Dual modes**: `analyze` (monitoring) or `enforce` (blocking)
- **DNS filtering**: DNSMasq with Quad9 upstream resolver
- **Firewall rules**: iptables prevents DNS bypass via direct IP connections
- **Sudo logging**: All sudo usage logged to `/var/log/safer-runner/main-sudo.log`
- **Sudo disabling**: Optionally disable sudo access after setup (prevents privilege escalation)
- **Docker disabling**: Optionally disable Docker access (prevents container escape attacks)
- **Custom domains**: Add trusted domains via input parameter
- **Automatic reporting**: Network access provenance in job summaries
- **Risky subdomain blocking**: Blocks gist.github.com and raw.githubusercontent.com by default in enforce mode

## Usage

⚠️ **Important**: Always place this action as the **first step** in your workflow to maximize security coverage.

ℹ️ **How it works**: This action uses a `pre` hook to establish security monitoring in analyze mode before any workflow steps run, then the main action applies your desired configuration (analyze or enforce mode).

### Analyze mode (default)

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: PortSwigger/safer-runner-action@b2208f653b6bf422e08501155f4df82bad008184 # v1.2.2
  - uses: actions/checkout@08c6903cd8c0fde910a37f88322edcfb5dd907a8 # v5.0.0
  - run: |
      curl https://example.com  # Logged but not blocked
```

### Enforce mode

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: PortSwigger/safer-runner-action@b2208f653b6bf422e08501155f4df82bad008184 # v1.2.2
    with:
      mode: 'enforce'
      allowed-domains: |
        example.com
        api.trusted-service.com
  - uses: actions/checkout@08c6903cd8c0fde910a37f88322edcfb5dd907a8 # v5.0.0
  - run: |
      curl https://api.trusted-service.com  # ✅ Allowed
      curl https://malicious.com  # ❌ Blocked
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `mode` | `analyze` (log only) or `enforce` (block) | `analyze` |
| `allowed-domains` | Additional domains to allow | `''` |
| `primary-dns-server` | Primary DNS server for allowed domains | `9.9.9.9` (Quad9) |
| `secondary-dns-server` | Secondary DNS server for redundancy | `149.112.112.112` (Quad9) |
| `fail-on-tampering` | Fail workflow if security config is tampered | `false` |
| `block-risky-github-subdomains` | Block gist.github.com and raw.githubusercontent.com in enforce mode | `true` |
| `disable-sudo` | Disable sudo access for runner user after setup | `false` |
| `sudo-config` | Custom sudoers configuration for runner user (multi-line string) | `''` |
| `disable-docker` | Remove runner user from docker group (prevents container usage) | `false` |

## Network Access Reports

Job summaries include a Network Access Provenance table showing:

- Domain/IP addresses accessed
- Ports used
- Status (✅ Allowed, ❌ Denied, 📊 Analyzed)
- Source (GitHub Required, User Defined)

In analyze mode, the report suggests an `allowed-domains` configuration based on non-GitHub domains accessed, making it easy to transition to enforce mode.

## Security Model

This action implements multi-layer security with DNS filtering, firewall rules, and privilege control. GitHub Actions required domains are automatically allowed. Sudo usage is always logged for auditability.

### Privilege Control (Optional)

Control sudo and Docker access to prevent privilege escalation and container escape attacks:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: PortSwigger/safer-runner-action@b2208f653b6bf422e08501155f4df82bad008184 # v1.2.2
    with:
      mode: 'enforce'
      disable-sudo: 'true'    # Prevents sudo usage after setup
      disable-docker: 'true'  # Prevents Docker/container usage
      allowed-domains: |
        registry.npmjs.org
  - run: npm ci && npm test   # ✅ Works without elevated privileges
  - run: sudo apt install x   # ❌ Fails (sudo disabled)
  - run: docker build .       # ❌ Fails (Docker disabled)
```

**Note**: Only disable sudo/Docker if your workflow doesn't require them. These are advanced security features that prevent malicious code from bypassing security controls.

### Custom DNS Servers

Configure alternative DNS providers while maintaining the same security guarantees:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: PortSwigger/safer-runner-action@b2208f653b6bf422e08501155f4df82bad008184 # v1.2.2
    with:
      mode: 'enforce'
      allowed-domains: 'npmjs.org pypi.org'
      primary-dns-server: '1.1.1.1'      # Cloudflare DNS
      secondary-dns-server: '1.0.0.1'    # Cloudflare secondary
  - run: npm install  # DNS queries use Cloudflare instead of Quad9
```

**Default DNS**: Quad9 (`9.9.9.9` / `149.112.112.112`), which filters known-malicious domains upstream of the action's own allowlist

**Disable secondary DNS** by passing an empty string (single DNS server only):

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: PortSwigger/safer-runner-action@b2208f653b6bf422e08501155f4df82bad008184 # v1.2.2
    with:
      mode: 'enforce'
      allowed-domains: 'example.com'
      primary-dns-server: '8.8.8.8'
      secondary-dns-server: ''  # Disable secondary DNS
```

**Note**: Both DNS servers must be explicitly allowed in firewall rules. The action automatically configures iptables to allow DNS traffic only from the dnsmasq process to the configured servers.

## Limitations

### Platform Support

- **GitHub-hosted runners**: Ubuntu only. Windows and macOS are not supported.
- **Self-hosted runners**: Ubuntu only, with sudo access and iptables. Other distributions (RHEL, Debian) are not supported.
- **Containerized jobs**: not supported. The action needs sudo on the runner itself, which a job running in a container does not have.

### Security Limitations

Network filtering provides a first line of defense but has limitations:

#### Timing Window
- **Pre-hook ordering**: This action's `pre:` hook establishes analyze mode monitoring before the main action step runs, providing early visibility
- **Other actions' pre-hooks**: Actions that appear later in the workflow will have their `pre:` hooks run after this action's pre-hook, so they are monitored
- **Actions before this one**: Any actions placed before this action in the workflow will have their `pre:` hooks run before monitoring is established
- **Mitigation**: Place this action as the first step in your workflow and carefully vet all actions used

#### Attack Vectors
- **Data exfiltration via allowed domains**: Abuse GitHub/npm/PyPI to upload secrets
- **Local file system attacks**: Stage data for later exfiltration
- **Process/system call abuse**: Container escapes, privilege escalation

### Defense in Depth

Combine with additional security layers:

- **Runtime security**: Falco, Tracee
- **Container security**: Distroless images, read-only filesystems, non-root users
- **Secrets management**: GitHub secrets, secure credential handling
- **Dependency scanning**: Snyk, Dependabot, GitHub native scanning
- **Action security**: Pin to commits, use trusted publishers
